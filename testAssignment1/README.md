Give your thoughts on TDD
Write your notes (in a readme file) regarding the TDD process, reflecting on
the following questions.
• What was positive and good about using TDD?
You notice errors faster, so you dont have to manually find the problems later.
You find errors before the users find them
You can confidently refactor the code afterwards
You think about the design of the code before you start to code, where you could loose overview when you sit in coding details
• What was annoying or difficult?
Getting used to write a test first, and purposely getting an "first" error.
writing double as much code(witch could leed to more problems)
• What surprised you?

• Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldn’t otherwise have thought
of?
I would never had written a test befor.

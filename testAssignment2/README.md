Reflections


Computer mouse:  
Identify the types of testing you would perform on a computer mouse, to
make sure that it is of the highest quality.

* Check if the sensor is good by moving the mouse across the mouse-pad. pressing the buttons a bunch of times to see if it registers it.  
gripping the mouse hard and see if the build is good. and last see how smooth the scroll wheel is.

Catastrophic failure:  
Find a story where a software system defect had a bad outcome. Describe
what happened. Can you identify a test that would have prevented it?
